## RNAseq Analysis: Daphnia Edition
The R scripts in the GO, GSEA, and ___ folders were written to assist Elizabeth Brooks in her research and dissertation. 
Elizabeth's research involves using short paired-end RNAseq reads to investigate how various Daphnia (water fleas) genotypes respond and deal with UV radiation. For example, some daphnia produce melanin, leading to pigmentation and protection against UV waves. Others use various DNA repair methods for which the genes and pathways activated by UV light are not well understood. My work in the Pfrender Lab involved a statistical investigation into the transcriptome changes in response to UV light with particular attention to DNA repair pathways across a mixture of UV tolerant and UV non-tolerant genotypes.
